# TMF Usage Management API RI

## Introduction

This is the code repository for the reference implementation of the TM Forum Usage Management API, used as part of
the FIWARE/TMForum Business API Ecosystem.

Please refer to the [Business API Ecosystem GitHub repo](https://github.com/FIWARE-TMForum/Business-API-Ecosystem) for more
details on this platform.

## API Overview

The Usage API provides standardized mechanism for usage management such as creation, update, retrieval,
import and export of a collection of usages.

Usage API manages both rated and non-rated usage.

For example, Usage API allows a service provider:

* To retrieve usage generated by a partner service platform in order to rate it
* To provide rated usage to a partner for consumption follow up purposes.
